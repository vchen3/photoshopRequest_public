		<h1>Task Instructions</h1>
		<h2>1) Indicate Request Validity</h2>
		<p>Imagine that you are an artist trying to edit this picture according to the request.  A request is valid if you know exactly what edits to make based on the request and the photo (e.g. "Please remove the people in the background" or "Please touch up this photo").  Invalid requests are non-specific instructions such as unclear requests (e.g. “Put me somewhere awesome”) or creative generation tasks (e.g. “Please make me a logo for my project").  </p>

		<h2>2) Select Request</h2>
		<p>If the submission's request is valid, copy and paste only the portion of the text that contains the request into the textbox below.  Ignore any unnecessary background information.  Click anywhere on the video below to see an example.</p>

		</video>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>3) Correct Request</h2>
		<p>After you have identified the request, please clarify and correct it.  For example, clarify a request such as "Touch this photo up" to "Increase the contrast and remove damage."  Corrections may include rephrasing, fixing spelling or grammatical errors, merging short sentences together, etc.  If you feel that the selected request is already clear and grammatically correct, you may submit the same response from 2).  Click anywhere on the video below to see an example.</p>
